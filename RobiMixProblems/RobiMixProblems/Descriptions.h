//Easy Problems :


//1. Create a vector of strings and print out each element using a range - based for loop.
//2. Create an array of integers with a size of 5 and initialize it with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Print out the sum of all the elements.
//3. Create a map where the key is a string and the value is an integer.Insert three key - value pairs and print out the value associated with a specific key.
//4. Create a set of integers and insert the values 5, 10, and 15. Print out the size of the set.
//5. Create a pair where the first element is a string and the second element is an integer.Initialize the pair with the values "key" and 10. Print out the first element of the pair.
//6. Create a string and concatenate it with another string using the + operator. Print out the resulting string.



//Medium Problems :


//1. Create a vector of integers and sort it in descending order.Print out the sorted vector.
//2. Create an array of floats with a size of 4 and initialize it with random values.Calculate the average of all the elements.
//3. Create a map where the key is an integer and the value is a vector of strings.Insert three key - value pairs and print out all the strings associated with a specific key.
//4. Create two sets of integers and perform a union operation to combine them into a new set.Print out the elements of the new set.
//5. Create a pair where the first element is a map of integers to strings and the second element is a vector of floats.Initialize the pair with some values and print out a specific float value.
//6. Create a string and convert it to uppercase using the transform function.Print out the uppercase string.


//Hard Problems :


//1. Create a vector of pairs where the first element is an integer and the second element is a string.Sort the vector by the integer value and print out the sorted pairs.
//2. Create a 2D array of integers with dimensions 3x3 and fill it with random values.Find the maximum value in the array and print out its location.
//3. Create a map where the key is a string and the value is a set of integers.Insert three key - value pairs and print out the sum of all the integers in the sets.
//4. Create two sets of pairs where the first element is a string and the second element is an integer.Perform an intersection operation to find the common pairs between the two sets.Print out the common pairs.
//5. Create a map where the key is a string and the value is a pair of floats.Insert three key - value pairs and print out the average of the float values.
//6. Create a string and remove all the vowels from it.Print out the resulting string.
